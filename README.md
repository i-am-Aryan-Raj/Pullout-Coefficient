# Pullout-Coefficient
## This project involves ranking of different ML model performances on prediction of Pullout Coefficient. It was completed under Professor Prashanth Vangla, IIT Delhi.
## The objectives of the project were:
1. Use different machine learning regression models to predict the pullout coefficient and compare their performances.
2. The models used were Random Forests, LinearGAM, DTR and MLP
3. Rank the models on the basis of their performances.
4. Many metrics were used like rmse, R2 Validation, MAPD to rank the models.
5. Futhermore, other validation methods like k, k', Ro2, Ro'2, Rs were used to check model reliability.
6. Finally, all the results and info was compiled in a ppt and a journal was published.
